This frees you from having to manually create and increment an indexing variable in a for loop. Calling `enumerate` on a sequence returns a tuple containing the index and element each time it is accessed. "

    "Generators are typically created using a special type of function called a generator function. These functions use the `yield` keyword to give values one at a time, rather than returning a single result. When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the entire function at once; it pauses at each `yield` statement until you request the next value.\n",
