### Why is NumPy faster than normal Python?

- [ ] The code typically has less lines.
- [ ] It does things in a non-Python background and never uses any Python commands.
- [ ] Because the NumPy ndarray has one data type and is memory-dense.
- [ ] It rewrote the existing Python functions in a smarter way.



### Which of the options will give you the maximum value of a NumPy array?

- [ ] `np.max(my_array)`
- [ ] `my_array(np.max)`
- [ ] `my_array.max()`
- [ ] None of the above.



### Arrays `A `and `B` have shapes (8, 1, 6, 1) and (7, 1, 5) respectively. What is the shape of `A*B`?

- [ ] (56, 1, 6, 5)
- [ ] (8, 7, 6, 5)
- [ ] (8, 1, 6, 1, 7, 1, 5)
- [ ] `A*B` is not a valid operation.
