### NumPy is faster than normal Python because

- [ ] The code typically has less lines to read.
- [ ] It does things in a non-Python background and never uses any Python commands.
- [ ] Because the NumPy ndarray has one data type and is memory-dense.
- [ ] It rewrote the existing Python functions in a smarter way.



### Which of the options will give you the maximum value of a 100x100x100 NumPy array?

- [ ] my_array(max)
- [ ] my_array.max()
- [ ] None of the above.



### I have two arrays A and B of size 8x1x6x1 and 7x1x5 respectively. What is the shape of A*B?

- [ ] 56x1x6x5
- [ ] 8x7x6x5
- [ ] 8x1x6x1x7x5
- [ ] It can't be multiplied.
