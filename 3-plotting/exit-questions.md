### When I make a plot, the x label is part of the

- [ ] Axes
- [ ] Artist
- [ ] Figure
- [ ] Axis



### An improvement on the plot shown (see screen) would be

- [ ] Adding lines to connect the points.
- [ ] Fitting a curve through the values.
- [ ] Putting the x,y-labels and ticks on all three plots.
- [ ] Including a legend.



### Mark the correct statements.

- [ ] Matplotlib's design is based on MATLAB.
- [ ] Figures should always be entirely in vector format.
- [ ] The default settings of Matplotlib give the optimal plot.
- [ ] Matplotlib's default colormap Viridis is considerate of colour-blindness.
