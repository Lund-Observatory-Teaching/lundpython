    "# A brief introduction to using Python in Astronomy\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this lesson is to introduce a few tools that can be very useful for working with Python. The benefits of using some of these tools might not be apparent immediately and you might choose not to use them in the ongoing courses. This is because their utility is correlated very strongly with the age of your code, the size of your code and the number of people you are collaborating with. So in a course project that you work on alone over a short time period of a couple of weeks and which does not involve much code you could get away with ignoring a lot of what is introduced in this notebook. But you will work on your Master's project over several months, most likely write quite a lot of code and at the very least you will be working together with your supervisor, so it is highly recommended that you incorporate the tools discussed below (or their analogues if you will be coding in some other language) into your workflow by that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NOTE:\n",
    "Some of the packages and tools used in this manual might not be installed by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often a good idea to run Python in a virtual environment, whether it is set up through the basic Python [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), the convenient [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), or Anaconda. Among many other benefits, this allows you to test your code in a clean environment to ensure that you have not forgotten to list any dependencies (which is important if anyone else ever tries to run your code), but also to install Python packages without requiring root access to your computer or interfering with the Python packages installed at the system level. At the moment you are likely already running Python in a virtual environment created by Anaconda, so you should already be somewhat familiar with the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PEP 8\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), commonly referred to as PEP 8, was already mentioned in the first lesson. Here we introduce tools that allow you to check if your code is PEP 8 compliant. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Ruff\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is a modern tool for checking codestyle (linting). The main difference between Ruff and earlier tools is that Ruff is much faster, making it possible for one tool to do work that might otherwise be split among several. Ruff can fix issues with obvious solutions and point out any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to check a Python script called 'helloworld.py' you would simply run\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ruff check helloworld.py\n",

    "The example above has produced more complaints than there are lines in the code, but all the error messages state exactly where the PEP 8 violations are located and what the problems are. This makes fixing them quite straightforward. It is also possible to get Ruff to automatically fix issues with simple solutions. To do this, run\n",

    "To use Ruff, first [install](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/) it, then follow the [getting started](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/tutorial/#getting-started) section of the documentation. You probably also want to go through the [configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/) to set up things like Jupyter notebook integration and shell auto-complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "## `black`\n",
    "\n",
    "[`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a commonly used and very opinionated automatic code formatter. \n",
    "It takes the burden of hand-formatting away from the user and lets them focus on the content. \n",
    "Clearly formatted code is easier and faster to read. `black` has hardly any settings and instead enforces good defaults. \n",
    "This makes `black`ened code consistent across projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some arguments that can be used are;\n",
    "```\n",
    "--check\n",
    "```\n",
    "will make `black` tell you which files it would change, but not actually make any changes, and\n",
    "```\n",
    "--diff\n",
    "```\n",
    "will make `black` tell you what specific changes it would make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing\n",
    "```\n",
    "--preview\n",
    "```\n",
    "will use experimental features like short string merging, which can be nice. Note that this is just an argument, you don't need an experimental version of ``black`` to try experimental features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many big and small projects already use `black` and enforce its use for their codebase. Ruff is made to work together with `black`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings are an important documentation tool in Python. In fact they are important enough that the conventions for writing docstrings are not provided in PEP 8, but separately in [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). You can think of docstrings as special comments that, differently from normal comments, are accessible from the Python interpreter. They are often used by IDEs but also for automatically generating online documentation. Very basic use of docstrings is demonstrated below."

    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to have some version control software manage your code. Not only would this allow you to restore older versions of your code repository, it can also help you to document how the code has evolved. If you are using [Git](https://git-scm.com) it is very simple to host your code (either privately or publicly) on [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (this list is far from being complete). This functions both as a backup in the cloud but also allows you to easily share your code with your collaborators (or at the very least your supervisor), though Git can certainly be useful even if you never share your repository with anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in version control then you can read more about it from [Chapter 1 Section 1 of the Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). If you are interested in using Git then you can continue on reading the book.\n",

    "## Slideshows\n",

    "Our presentations use a sort of \"slideshow\" version of Jupyter notebooks. There are a few ways this can be done, and we have used [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/).\n",

    "Once you have installed it, you will find the following button in your notebooks:\n",

    "![](https://lund-observatory-teaching.github.io/lundpython/imgs/RISE1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Which will take you into a presentation mode of your notebook. But before you do that, you need to specify which cells, both markdown and code, belong to a slide. For this, you will want to see slide types under `View > Cell Toolbar > Slideshow`, seen as <strong style=\"color:red\">a</strong> in the following figure:\n",
